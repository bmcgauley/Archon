### üîÑ Project Awareness & Context
- **Always read `PLANNING.md`** at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.
- **Check `TASK.md`** before starting a new task. If the task isn‚Äôt listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- **Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as described in `PLANNING.md`.

### üß± Code Structure & Modularity
- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.
- **Use clear, consistent imports** (prefer relative imports within packages).
- **If user request is lacking clarity, always use brave search to search for more context**
- **Always use sequential thinking, memory, context7 for coding tasks**
- **Always use the most up-to-date coding style appropriate given the context7 documentation**

### üß™ Testing & Reliability
- **Always create unit tests for new features** (functions, classes, routes, etc).
- **After updating any logic**, check whether existing unit tests need to be updated. If so, do it.
- **Tests should live in a `/tests` folder** mirroring the main app structure.
  - Include at least:
    - 1 test for expected use
    - 1 edge case
    - 1 failure case

### ‚úÖ Task Completion
- **Mark completed tasks in `TASK.md`** immediately after finishing them.
- Add new sub-tasks or TODOs discovered during development to `TASK.md` under a ‚ÄúDiscovered During Work‚Äù section.
- **At the end of a completion of a task, always update the progress of the project through the Jira/Atlassian MCP and always provide a direct link for tracking.

### üìé Style & Conventions
- **Use Python** as the primary language.
- **Follow PEP8**, use type hints, and format with `black`.
- **Use `pydantic` for data validation**.
- Use `FastAPI` for APIs and `SQLAlchemy` or `SQLModel` for ORM if applicable.
- Write **docstrings for every function** using the Google style:
  ```python
  def example():
      """
      Brief summary.

      Args:
          param1 (type): Description.

      Returns:
          type: Description.
      """
  ```

### üìö Documentation & Explainability
- **Update `README.md`** when new features are added, dependencies change, or setup steps are modified.
- **Comment non-obvious code** and ensure everything is understandable to a mid-level developer.
- When writing complex logic, **add an inline `# Reason:` comment** explaining the why, not just the what.

### üß† AI Behavior Rules
- **Never assume missing context. Ask questions if uncertain.**
- **Never hallucinate libraries or functions** ‚Äì only use known, verified Python packages.
- **Always confirm file paths and module names** exist before referencing them in code or tests.
- **Never delete or overwrite existing code** unless explicitly instructed to or if part of a task from `TASK.md`.

you are to always use appropriate MCP tools for the task. List of tools:

# Enhanced MCP Tool Usage Guidelines

## üîß General MCP Tool Principles

- **Understand tool capabilities** before invoking them - each tool has specific strengths and use cases.
- **Respect token efficiency** - only retrieve what's needed and process large datasets incrementally.
- **Validate inputs and outputs** for each tool to ensure reliable operation.
- **Handle errors gracefully** with informative error messages and recovery strategies.
- **Maintain context** between tool interactions to build on previous results.

## üìö Context7 Documentation Tool

### When to Use:
- When implementing features that depend on third-party libraries or frameworks.
- When needing up-to-date API documentation that might have changed since training data.
- To verify correct usage patterns, parameters, or return types for external libraries.
- When exploring alternative libraries for a specific functionality.

### Best Practices:
- **Always use two-step process**: First resolve the library ID, then fetch documentation.
- **Be specific with topics** to get targeted documentation instead of general overviews.
- **Request appropriate token limits** based on the complexity of the documentation needed.
- **Cache documentation results** when working extensively with a particular library.
- **Extract and highlight key information** rather than pasting full documentation.

## üîç Brave Search Tool

### When to Use:
- When needing information beyond training cutoff date (currently October 2024).
- When researching library-specific best practices or common issues.
- When looking for reference implementations or code examples.
- When investigating compatibility issues between libraries or versions.
- When researching performance considerations for specific technologies.

### Best Practices:
- **Construct precise queries** using technical terms and specific version numbers when applicable.
- **Search in iterations**, starting with broad queries and then refining based on initial results.
- **Combine search terms** with framework names to get context-specific results.
- **Prioritize official documentation** sources over forum posts or blogs.
- **Verify recency of information** when dealing with rapidly evolving frameworks.
- **Cite sources** in code comments when implementing solutions found through search.

## üìÇ Filesystem Tool

### When to Use:
- When analyzing project structure at the beginning of tasks.
- When locating relevant files for modification.
- When verifying existence of files or directories before operations.
- When reading file content to understand implementation details.
- When creating new files or updating existing ones.
- When executing batch operations across multiple files.

### Best Practices:
- **Always check file existence** before attempting to read or modify.
- **Use directory_tree** for initial project exploration to understand structure.
- **Leverage search_files** with appropriate patterns to locate relevant files.
- **Get file metadata** before performing large operations to understand size constraints.
- **Use incremental edits** for large files rather than full rewrites.
- **Create directory structures** before writing files to avoid path errors.
